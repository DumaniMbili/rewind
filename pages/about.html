              Her dedication to the craft led her to pursue further studies in
              Fine Art and Design, where she secured top honors in drawing and
              design. Cristelle's vibrant spirit, unwavering determination, and
              undeniable talent continue to leave an indelible mark on the
              realms of creativity and philanthropy, illuminating the path she

              Rewind was born from a compelling vision: to curate a captivating
              experience for young adults in Durban. Our aim is to provide an
              avenue for exploration of new restaurants while fostering skill
              development, savoring live music by local artists, and creating
              lasting memories.<br /><br />
              Most importantly, Rewind serves as a platform for networking with
              diverse individuals from various walks of life. We redefine the
              concept of a typical Sip & Paint event by offering a premium
              experience at an accessible middle-class price point. While our
              brand initially revolved around Sip & Paint events, we are driven
              by a broader mission to uplift and showcase emerging artists.<br /><br />
              Rewind aims to provide these talented individuals with the
              professional platform they deserve, enabling them to showcase
              their work to a local audience and establish valuable connections
              within the art world. Over the course of our journey, we have
              already achieved notable success. Two of our Sip & Paint events
              were resounding hits at renowned venues such as Grimaldis Umhlanga
              and Madam & Sir on Florida.<br /><br />
              Furthermore, we organized exceptional jazz and poetry nights at
              Jazzy Rainbow and Lucky's Bar in Windermere before their
              unfortunate closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At Rewind, our
              target is to continue captivating and engaging our audience with a
              range of events and experiences. We are dedicated to creating a
              vibrant atmosphere where young adults can immerse themselves in
              art, music, and culinary delights.<br /><br />
              By doing so, we aspire to foster connections, inspire creativity,
              and contribute to the growth and development of Durban's cultural
              landscape.
